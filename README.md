# Geometry Dash Optimizer

This program automatically sets Geometry Dash to High Priority, and Discord to Low Priority.
As more optimizes are found, they will be added so make sure to keep up to date, will post updates on Twitter as well.

OPEN THIS PROGRAM ONLY AFTER OPENING GD.

"main.py" is the source code for the executable. "GD_Optimizer.exe" should work for everyone without the requirement of Python.

# Working Operating Systems

- Windows 11
- Windows 10

This list will be updated with more operating systems that are confirmed to work. 

# This is the Dev build.

This is used for public testing of new versions. 
If you find any issues contact me anywhere ASAP.

# Changelog
